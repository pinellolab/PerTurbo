## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

-   The structured nuisance algebra reduced over batch levels with a scatter-add,
    whose accelerator cost grows as the segment count *falls* because colliding
    rows serialize on one output address. A batch covariate is the worst case:
    tens of levels over hundreds of thousands of cells. `_segment_sum` now
    contracts against the indicator matrix instead - the same sum written as a
    matrix product - for designs below 256 groups, keeping the scatter beyond
    that, where it wins. The indicator is materialized as `(cells, groups)` and
    never as the full nuisance design, so the arrow structure of `Z'WZ` is
    untouched; only the reduction changes. On a 126,154-cell TAP-seq screen with
    a 14-level batch covariate, the all-cells propensity CRT over 1,041 elements
    and 68 genes went from 2,630 s to 76 s measured back to back on one V100;
    its batched logistic IRLS from 10.3 s to 0.12 s per 64 elements, and
    `fisher_nb_null` from 1.12 s to 0.05 s. Without a batch covariate the same
    run took 15 s, so the structured route was costing 35x the design it was
    meant to make cheap. Saddlepoint p-values move by less than the run-to-run
    spread the scatter itself produced: against a stored reference run, the
    median relative change is 6.0e-7 where an unmodified rerun gives 1.1e-6, and
    no call changes at p < 0.05, 1e-3 or 1e-5.

## [2.0.0rc8] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

-   Perturbation targets with no assigned cell no longer abort a control-anchored
    CRT run. The low-MOI design keeps only cells carrying exactly one
    perturbation, so a sparse guide can lose every cell - 37 of 4,120 guides on a
    real TAP-seq screen had none to begin with. Those targets are dropped from the
    design, reported on stdout with a count and a truncated name list, and counted
    in `crt_metadata.json` as `targets_without_assigned_cells`. Their
    `element_effects` rows remain present with missing CRT statistics, so a fixed
    target set still resolves and an untested target stays distinguishable from one
    that tested null. An input where *every* target is empty is still fatal.
-   Grouping guides into elements is a sparse product. The dense int8 product had
    no BLAS kernel and ran for hours on one core on a 233,000-cell screen before
    anything reached the GPU.
-   High-MOI CLI chunking retains co-occurring predictors by fitting gene blocks
    instead of dropping other perturbation columns. Sparse assignments remain
    compact through loading and cell minibatching.
-   Observed size factors preserve zero-count cells and full-panel centering.
    Simulation bundles retain the fitted offsets and all chunked guide posterior
    fields; fixed-zero offsets remain distinct from counts-derived offsets.
-   Shared element means no longer count duplicate guides twice when perturbation
    dispersion is enabled. Mixture-NB simulation leaves the outlier component
    independent of the perturbation mean, matching the fitted likelihood.
-   Log-normal NB quadrature uses log weights, and sampling applies the requested
    sample shape once.
-   Release tests and build checks run for `v2-port`; package validation supports
    the build backend's metadata version.
-   The float32 pin read the variational parameters through their constraints and
    handed them back to the optimizer unconstrained, so every positive scale
    restarted at exp of its value and stage one began 40% above its reference
    loss. rc1 and rc2 carry this; the pin now works in the optimizer's own space.

### Added

-   PerTurbo 2.0 replaces the default implementation with NumPyro/JAX.
-   The former PyTorch/Pyro/scvi implementation is isolated under the deprecated
    `perturbo.legacy` optional extra.
-   Cortado-format MuData registrations and fit bundles are read compatibly and
    migrated to the PerTurbo v2 format when saved.

### Changed

-   Python 3.11 is now the minimum supported version.
-   The command-line entry point is `perturbo`.
-   Perturbation codes are 32-bit. A chunk holding a single perturbation received
    8-bit categorical codes from pandas, and stage two then failed where it
    combined them with the first chunk's perturbation count.
-   Guide-level summaries are derived only where a guide's effect differs from its
    element's. Under the shared strategy it does not, so nothing is derived and
    consumers join the element table through the guide map; under the offset
    strategy the moments are closed-form; only the relative strategy samples, and
    it does so in bounded element and guide blocks. The previous implementation
    drew 64 samples of the whole effect matrix whatever the strategy, tens of
    gigabytes on a screen-scale fit.

### Fixed

-   A perturbation with more cells than `--max-chunk-size` no longer aborts the
    run. It takes a chunk of its own, and the run reports which perturbations did
    so and which one sets peak memory. Screens exist with tens of thousands of
    cells behind one perturbation, and a perturbation's cells cannot be split
    across chunks without breaking its estimate.
